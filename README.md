# Create-a-program-that-uses-an-array-of-Shape-references-to-objects-of-each-concrete-class-in-the-hie
Implement a Shape hierarchy as shown in the figure above. Each Two Dimensional Shape should contain method get_Area and get_Info to calculate the area and print the height and width of the two-dimensional shape. Each Three Dimensional Shape should have methods get_Area and get_Volume to calculate the surface area and volume, respectively, of the three-dimensional shape. Create a program that uses an array of Shape references to objects of each concrete class in the hierarchy. The program should print a text description of the object to which each array element refers. Also, in the loop that processes all shapes in the array, determine whether each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or a ThreeDimensionalShape. If it is a TwoDimensionalShape, display its area. If itâ€™s a ThreeDimensionalShape, display its area and volume.
